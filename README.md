# albert_farhutdinov_portfolio

Welcome! My name is Albert Farhutdinov. This is my portfolio. I collect here various small scripts written in Python and JavaScript by me. You can find descriptions for these scripts and requirements for their correct running below.

## Python

### Requirements

1. Before you start, make sure that you have Python 3.7 or later versions. Input this command into terminal:

        python --version
  
2. Install the necessary libraries in your environment for correct running of scripts in folders "kivy_calculator", "yandex_music_chart" and "matplotlib":

		pip install -r kivy_calculator/kivy_requirements.txt
		pip install -r yandex_music_chart/requirements.txt
		pip install -r matplotlib/matplotlib_requirements.txt
    
3. Scripts "integral.py", "equation.py" and "tabulation.py" require the script "input_functions.py" from folder "python" of this portfolio.
