# albert_farhutdinov_portfolio

Welcome! My name is Albert Farhutdinov. This is my portfolio. I collect here various small scripts written in Python and JavaScript by me. You can find descriptions for these scripts and requirements for their correct running below.

## Python

### Requirements

1. Before you start, make sure that you have Python 3.7 or later versions. Input this command into terminal:

        python --version
  
2. Install the necessary libraries in your environment for correct running of scripts in folders "kivy_calculator", "yandex_music_chart" and "matplotlib":

		pip install -r kivy_calculator/kivy_requirements.txt
		pip install -r yandex_music_chart/requirements.txt
		pip install -r matplotlib/matplotlib_requirements.txt
    
3. Scripts "integral.py", "equation.py" and "tabulation.py" require the script "input_functions.py" from folder "python" of this portfolio.

### Descriptions

The Python directory contains the following folders and scripts:

#### console_manager

The console manager contains functions for creating, copying and deleting files and folders, obtaining a list of files in the working directory and changing the directory. The script "core.py" contains descriptions of these functions. The script "main.py" contains the work logic of the manager. To run the manager, go to "console_manager" directory:

	cd console_manager
	
Then input:

	python main.py help
	
You will see the list of available commands, which you can input instead of "help". Some of them also require to input name of file or folder to be created, copied or deleted.

#### kivy_calculator

Calculator with basic arithmetic operations, created with Kivy library. Before you run it, read "Requirements".

#### matplotlib

There are 4 small tasks for mathematical statistics. Task conditions described in the scripts comments. Before you run it, read "Requirements".
